Fly, Stay, Experience

Planda is a traveling powerhouse. Whether you’re looking to spend your next vacation in Bali or take the kids to Disney World in the summer, Thrille makes it easy by aggregating your expenses and saving you money.

With Planda’s machine learning(not yet built) algorithm, you can rest assure that you are getting the most bang for your buck on your next vacation. Planda finds the best housing, transportation, and activities deals on the market and adjusts them based on your preferences.

A money pool allows you and anyone else to contribute to the overall cost of the trip. Creating a trip opens up a money pool. As the trip host, you will be able to visually see the contributions made to the trip allowing you to deposit and withdrawal from the pool as long as funds are available.
